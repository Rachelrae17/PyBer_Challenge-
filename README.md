# PyBer_Challenge-
Project #5 
1.	Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this challenge was to create a visual representation of the data of ride share. We looked at urban, rural, and suburban areas as well as the total rides, total drivers and the total fares to be able to calculate and analyze the numbers to draw a conclusion. Being able to calculate the number of rides that happen each day. With the amount of drivers, we need to give the rides in each area and the cost of each ride and the income of the driver. 
2.	Results: The results from doing this study, I was able to gather that which city types and the amount of money that was produce by using ride share. Urban city type produces the most amount highest profit margin of money in using ride shares. Rural areas use ride share the least and brings in the lowest amount of money. Suburban is our medium with rideshare on the amount rides and drivers used as well as the profit margin was medium between all three city types.

3.	Summary: The three business recommendations that I have for the CEO for ride share would be one, have more availability or employment for the drivers in the urban city because that is where you produce the most rides. Two, I suggest having a higher fare cost in the urban area because then you could make more of a profit the driver and ride share because you know there are more people so they will pay for service of the ride as well as it is in such high demand. Three, I would adjust the ride share fares for the suburban area and have the fare go up by 5% just so you can make more of a profit in that margin and the service is still going more and more in a higher demand.
